                <h3><strong>1.Forgetting the keys</strong></h3>
                <P> As you become successful, do not forget the keys to happiness.
                    ‘Happiness resides not in possessions, and not in gold, happiness dwells in the soul.’
                    —Democritus
                    It may have been a mistake to publicly announce that my favourite cuisine
                    comes from the south of India, because the whole year, it was sambar for
                    breakfast, sambar for lunch and sambar for dinner. In fact, sambars followed me
                    everywhere I went. For those of you who do not know, sambar is a lentil-based
                    vegetable stew, which accompanies famous rice-based dishes such as dosa or
                    idli. From the United Kingdom to Australia, everyone who invited me to their
                    home fed me their version of this much-loved lentil soup. Having had so much
                    of it, it was only natural that I became a connoisseur of the dish; I knew where to
                    find the best sambar in any town, let alone my own. And that is where our story
                    begins.
                    Although I grew up in Pune, my heart lies in a simple ashram, paradoxically
                    situated amidst the skyline of downtown Mumbai. I have lived there as a monk
                    for twenty-two years, where I have not only been studying ancient eastern
                    wisdom for my enrichment, but also learning how to share its practical
                    application with the world. People who attend my lectures regularly invite me to
                    have lunch at their homes but, to their disappointment, I usually decline. As a
                    monk, I have to be cautious of overindulgence; it is essential to stay regulated in
                    our habits. But after months of pleading, I hesitantly accepted an invitation to go
                    to Mr and Mrs Iyer’s home, a decision which would deepen my understanding of
                    happiness in the long run.
                </P>

                <H3><strong>2.Seeing beyound the obivious</strong></H3>
                <P> Have you ever walked into a room where two people have argued? You can
                    immediately sense the stale energy in the room; the silence between them can be
                    deafening. Miscommunication can spark similar tension. When Harry fell silent I
                    found myself wondering: Had I said something wrong? Had I offended him?
                    Insulting someone who has hosted you at their home is one of the most
                    regrettable things one can do. Two minutes passed before I decided to break the
                    deadlock.
                    ‘So where did you buy this car?’ I asked trying to change the subject to
                    something more palatable.
                    Harry appreciated that I was trying to find common ground and followed suit.
                    He still didn’t feel comfortable sharing with me whatever it was he was thinking.
                    ‘Well, I needed to buy a car after I sold the Mercedes. My wife and I were taking
                    cabs everywhere for the first few weeks. One day when we were visiting some
                    friends in Juhu, the cab stopped at a traffic light directly outside the Lexus
                    showroom. That was when I saw her—sparkling from within the polished glass.
                    It was love at first sight!’ He cheered up at that memory..</P>

                <H3><strong>3.The journey begins</strong></H3>
                <P> What do we do when people we are close to are sharing their worries with us? I
                    wanted to say so much as Harry spoke of his inner turmoil, but then I
                    remembered my training as a monk: Our silent presence can be more powerful
                    than a million empty words. We all have two ears and one mouth; the amount we
                    listen and the amount we speak should be done proportionately. Rarely do
                    people want an active solution to their problems before they have been
                    thoroughly heard and understood.
                    I remember the early days when people used to come and confide in me. I was
                    a young, eager, fresh-faced monk then, keen to save the world with my
                    newfound sense of purpose. In my immaturity, I would pounce on the solution as
                    soon as it came to me, not understanding that people don’t care what you know
                    unless they know you care. In fact, the answer to all problems related to the
                    human condition seldom excludes a conscious, compassionate ear. The attitude
                    of listening attentively is equally essential to the solutions we may present. I was
                    not going to make that mistake this time with Harry.</P>

                <H3><strong>4.Growing through gratitude</strong></H3>
                <P> Harry’s fair complexion brought out the contrast in his dark-brown eyes. The
                    eyes are the window to the soul, I thought. As he stared at me, I noticed parts of
                    his sclera were bloodshot, partly from the stress of telling me his miseries and
                    partly from the excitement of the conversation that lay ahead of us.
                    ‘The traffic of the mind, you were saying . . .’ Harry said, eager to get back on
                    track again. We lost eye contact briefly as he stretched his neck above the
                    steering wheel to see if the traffic was clearing ahead. It was, albeit at a sluggish
                    pace. ‘So, the traffic of the mind,’ he repeated.
                    ‘The traffic of the mind,’ I smiled at him. ‘The mind is what we use to
                    perceive the world. We don’t see things as they are, we see things as we are.
                    Like your sunglasses . . .’ I pointed to his designer glasses resting on the
                    dashboard. ‘When you wear them, the way you see the world changes. Things
                    that once looked bright now look dull and lifeless. The things themselves haven’t
                    changed. Our perception has.’ The car at a complete standstill, Harry fiddled
                    with the frames of his sunglasses, pondering my point.
                    ‘But things do change over time. My wife and I have become entirely
                    different people.’</P>

                <P>
                    Worli Sea Face has some of the most expensive homes in the city. Business
                    tycoons, movie stars and even cricket players; the postcode is littered with
                    famous names. I pointed at one of the new-builds shooting up. ‘That belongs to
                    one of my close friends,’ I said. Harry looked at me with surprise.
                    ‘I was under the impression that I would be your richest friend,’ he said,
                    shrugging innocently.
                    ‘You are one of them, of course. For your age, no one can mock your success.
                    But these people are playing in another league. This building is going to be ten
                    floors!’
                    Harry bent his neck to look outside my window to see men in thin neon
                    jackets and yellow helmets hard at work, constructing a billionaire’s paradise.
                    ‘I wish I could afford an apartment in it,’ he said. </P>

                <H3><strong>6.Why worry</strong></H3>
                <P>
                    One sultry evening, as I sat typing away at my laptop in my room, I received a
                    WhatsApp message from a friend of mine. It did not look like anything out of
                    the ordinary, but it had the potential to ruin my life. However, before I elaborate,
                    I think it is important to tell the story of WhatsApp’s success for the benefit of
                    those readers who are not familiar with how it came about.
                    WhatsApp, as we all may know, is a free messaging and calling application
                    that anyone can download, anywhere in the world except China. It was founded
                    by Brian Acton, a software engineer who graduated from Stanford. Acton
                    worked at Apple first and then Yahoo for around a dozen years, until in 2007, he
                    decided to travel to South America for a year with his friend and colleague Jan
                    Koum. On their return, both of them applied to Facebook and Twitter for jobs
                    but both were rejected. Acton tweeted in May 2009, ‘Got denied by Twitter HQ.
                    That’s okay. Would have been a long commute.’ A few months later, in August
                    2009, he followed it up with another tweet, ‘Facebook turned me down. It was a
                    great opportunity to connect with some fantastic people. Looking forward to
                    life’s next adventure. </P>

            <a name="Q7"></a>
                <H3><strong>7.Spiritual practise</strong></H3>
                <P>
                    Spirituality is based on the premise that we live in this world, but we are not
                    from it. Many of our problems lie in not understanding our fundamental identity:
                    we are not human beings having spiritual experiences; we are spiritual beings
                    having human experiences. It’s impossible to realize this principle theoretically.
                    We can attend hundreds of lectures and read volumes of books; but this is
                    inadequate without us committing to a spiritual practice, or sadhana as it is
                    known in Sanskrit.
                    The simplest way to explain spiritual practice is to describe the hierarchy of
                    connections. At any moment, we can be making three kinds of connections:
                    Outside ourselves: The majority of our time is spent in connecting with the
                    world—networking, relationships, our work. It’s all crucial, but can lead us
                    astray if we have no inner direction. The fear of missing out, thinking that the
                    grass is greener elsewhere, and living a life out of balance are all symptoms of
                    having incorrectly prioritized happiness outside of ourselves.
                    Inside ourselves: Beyond our everyday lives, many look for solace within.
                    People struggling with life, those trying to work on themselves to conquer the
                    external world, those curious about their inner world, and occasionally, a few of
                    those seeking the truth—these are the types of people who will take the journey
                    within.</P>

                <H3><strong>8.Speaking sensitively</strong></H3>
                <P>
                    ‘What do you mean how you treat your wife?’ I asked him, alarmed. I had been
                    to their house and found nothing amiss. Was there something he wasn’t sharing?
                    ‘It’s not what it sounds like,’ he said, blushing. ‘It is just that we are constantly
                    fighting and bickering. She always wants to change things about me, and I end
                    up leaving the room when she starts with her suggestions.’
                    I was quite taken aback by his comments. How people behave in public can be
                    very different from how they are in their private lives.
                    ‘Just a few minutes ago I was experiencing the warmth in the exchanges
                    between you two,’ I said.
                    ‘I suppose we act differently depending on whose company we are in.’ He
                    paused for a moment. ‘How can we maintain the “spark” that we once had?
                    What you witnessed at my home today was what it was constantly like in
                    America when we were together, but it slowly started to fizzle out. Why does
                    this happen?’
                    There was a series of things I wanted to say. I started by comforting him, ‘This
                    happens with all relationships, not just in marriages. If we are not proactive in
                    our relationships, they start to seem dry and become cumbersome. We have to
                    have respect for the other person, which is reflected in how sensitively we treat
                    them. </P>

                <H3><strong>9.A virtuous vision</strong></H3>
                <P>
                    With car horns blaring around us and crows squawking above us, we were still
                    stuck, but were also edging closer to our destination. We still did not know what
                    was causing the traffic jam. Harry asked if he could switch off the air
                    conditioning, saying, ‘The AC gives me a sore throat sometimes. Is it ok if I
                    open the window a little? I hope you don’t mind.’
                    ‘Of course not,’ I replied as we both rolled down the windows a few
                    centimetres.
                    ‘Please continue with what you were saying,’ Harry said.
                    I was about to begin speaking when a bumblebee flew into the car. Bees are
                    usually harmless, but in such a confined space, Harry and I both threw our heads
                    back against the head rests and remained completely still. Our yellow-and-black
                    friend buzzed around the dashboard of the car. Mesmerized by the jasminescented
                    car fragrance flowing out of the vents, it was probably looking for
                    flowers. When it realized there was no pollen in our vehicle, it flew away
                    merrily, singing the song all bees sing. </P>

                    ‘Most of the time our frustration comes from improper dealings in our
                    relationships,’ I said, trying to console Harry. ‘And this stems from our
                    communication, whether it’s our body language, actions or words. We must take
                    full responsibility for our relationships,’ I continued.
                    ‘But if I’m always thinking about what to say to not upset my wife, that would
                    make life miserable and so calculated,’ Harry retorted.
                    I sighed. ‘Harry, yes, we must choose our words carefully when we are
                    correcting others, but before that we must learn to invest appreciation in them.’
                    I settled down to explain in detail.</P>
